## Future Improvements

Konami-JS is an ancient project by JavaScript standards, having started in 2009! I would love for 2018 to be the year it gets rewritten in a more modern, ES6-friendly way while incorporating something like [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to ensure backwards compatibility in older browsers.

I would love the community's help in any of this ðŸ˜ƒ

You can watch [me](https://george.mand.is) talk about the history of Konami-JS and the value of maintaining "frivolous" open-source projects at OdessaJS 2017 here: [https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3xI3ps7syI](https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3xI3ps7syI)</p>

Your pull requests are welcome! Emphasis on small footprints, speed and broad device/browser compatability. Less interested in package manager and toolchain integrations.
